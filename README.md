# nutnet-grasslands

This is the repository for R scripts used to study the microbial communities having the genetic potential to fix atmospheric N<sub>2</sub> in grassland soils. The sites used for this study were part of the Nutrient Network (NutNet) - a globally replicated experiment investigating the effects of nutrient addition and herbivores on grassland ecosystems.
